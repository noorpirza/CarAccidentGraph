# CarAccidentGraph
This graph demosntrates data from car accidents in Chicago in 2023. It is reasonable to expect that car accidents will be clustered around streets with a speed limit of 30-40 miles per hour, as shown in the graph, because the streets are busy and the speed limit is high enough that drivers may not see pedestrians, whereas pedestrians are not likely to be presents on streets with the highest speed limits. At lower speed limits, while there are a significant number of accidents, the number of injuries are lower. This may be a reflection of the type of street (highway, side street), rather than the speed limit. There was no clear pattern on whether traffic control devices affect accidents.
